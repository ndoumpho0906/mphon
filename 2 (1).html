            <p>
                My love, I can’t even begin to tell you how ashamed and heartbroken I am over everything that’s happened. I know I broke your trust, and it pains me more than you know to see how much I’ve hurt you. What makes it even worse is disappointing you in front of your friends by acting like a pervert. I’m so embarrassed and sorry for putting you in that position. If you don’t want to talk to me right now, I get it – I’m ashamed to even face you after all that. Please don’t worry about me today; I’m fine. What matters most is that you’re okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I’ve consistently done the same hurtful things again and again, and for that, I am deeply, deeply sorry. It breaks my heart that I haven’t been able to change yet, but I promise you, I’m working hard to become the man you deserve. It’s not easy, and I’m struggling, but I’m not giving up. I just need your patience and support, because I know this is going to take more effort and time than I imagined. But please know, I’m committed. I love you, and I’m determined to prove that with my actions, not just words.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are so incredibly worthy, beautiful, and full of values that inspire me every single day. I know you probably don’t trust the things I say right now – and I don’t blame you after I broke your trust as a boyfriend. But remember how we started, on June 25, 2023? That day was the beginning of something so special, and I still believe in us, even through the mistakes. I know I kept you up late when you should have been resting peacefully, and I’m sorry for stealing that peace from you. You deserve so much better than what I’ve given you lately, but I promise you – I will change. You mean everything to me, and I’ll keep fighting to make things right. I love you, more than words can express, and I’m deeply, deeply sorry.
            </p>
